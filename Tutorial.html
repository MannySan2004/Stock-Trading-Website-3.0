            <h2>What is the Stock Market</h2>
            <p>The stock market is a platform where shares of publicly traded companies are issued, bought, and sold. It serves as a marketplace where investors can trade ownership in companies. The main functions of the stock market include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Capital Raising:</strong> Companies raise capital by issuing shares to the public through Initial Public Offerings (IPOs).</li>
                <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> The stock market provides a liquid environment where investors can buy and sell shares easily.</li>
                <li><strong>Price Discovery:</strong> Stock prices are determined by supply and demand dynamics in the market, reflecting the value of companies based on investor perceptions and market conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulation and Protection:</strong> Stock exchanges and regulatory bodies like the SEC ensure fair trading practices and protect investors.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Stock markets are typically divided into primary and secondary markets. The primary market is where new issues are sold to investors for the first time, while the secondary market is where previously issued securities are traded among investors.</p>

            <h2>How the Stock Market Works</h2>
            <p>At its core, the stock market operates through a network of exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ. Companies list their shares on these exchanges through a process called an Initial Public Offering (IPO).</p>
            <p>Investors can then buy and sell these shares through stockbrokers. Prices of stocks fluctuate based on supply and demand, investor sentiment, and other market factors.</p>
            <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shares:</strong> Units of ownership in a company.</li>
                <li><strong>Dividends:</strong> Portions of a company's earnings distributed to shareholders.</li>
                <li><strong>Bull Market:</strong> A market condition where prices are rising or expected to rise.</li>
                <li><strong>Bear Market:</strong> A market condition where prices are falling or expected to fall.</li>
